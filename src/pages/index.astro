            I am a PhD student in Mathematics and Statistics at McGill
            University, specializing in deep learning, conformal prediction, and
            survival analysis, with a strong foundation in statistics and
            computer science from my first-class honours bachelor's degree. As a
            former software developer with four years of industry experience, I
            excel in designing and building robust, efficient systems. I thrive
            in collaborative environments and applying technical skills to
            address interdisciplinary challenges in machine learning and
            statistical modeling.
